                    Established in 1969 with a goal to educate the unpreveliged section of our society, the Students Guardian Teacher Welfare Society is now indulged in many welfare activities.
                    We always believe in <i><strong>"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"</strong></i>&nbsp; which means that this whole world is a family and we all are a part of it.
                    Together, we can bring a positive change to this world. And educating people is the best way to do it. That's exactly why we focus on educating people.
                    In addition with modern education, we teach children the lessons of <i><strong>Sanatan Dharma</strong></i> in order to make them a good human being who will further make her/his contribution for the betterment of our society.
                    We strongly believe that bookish knowledge isn't enough to counter the harsh challenges of outer world. A comprehensive development of a person's intellect, behaviour and perception are equally important in this journey that we know as <i><strong>"Life"</strong></i>.

                    It's 21st century, and in today's era, education without employment is considered a bane! That's we don't just provide education but we also help rural people gain some skills and get employeed.
                    Fortunately, our work is not limited to men only. We continuously put efforts to give more-and-more employment opportunities to women belonging to rural areas.
                    Thanks to these initiatives, the number women participating in these activities is exponentially increasing. From this, we can understand the fact that women are keen to learn and grow; the only thing they lack is "opportunity".

                We are on a journey; a journey to educate those who can't afford it, to bring employment to those who are sleeping with empty stomachs, to guide those who have lost their hopes due to addiction and to protect our mother nature who is nourishing all of us without demanding anything in exchange!
                You know what's the most intresting thing is? We've been doing this from over 53 years and we don't have any plans to stop in near future.
